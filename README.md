# HIBOPCovid
Hospital and ICU Bed Occupancy Prediction in COVID-19
The main purpose of the tool is to forecast the ICU and hospital bed occupancy 
by COVID-19 patients over a period of time in the future. Here “hospital bed occupancy” 
comprises both ICU and non-ICU beds. Also, the tool can be validated using past
periods in order to assess its predictive power for the hospital or region under study.
